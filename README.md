# Travel Planner

This is a Vite + React web app for travel planning. The app features a country selector dropdown. When a user selects a country, a mock travel plan for that country is displayed. No backend is required; all data is mocked in the frontend.

## Features
- Country selector dropdown
- Generates a travel plan for the selected country
- Modern React + Vite setup

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser at the local address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Customization
- To add more countries or update travel plans, edit the `mockPlans` and `countries` arrays in `src/App.jsx`.
